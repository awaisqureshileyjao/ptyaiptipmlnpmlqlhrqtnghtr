<p>When you sign up for a specific newsletter, we {$settings.Company.company_name} add your email address to a corresponding mailing list. While it is there, we know that we can contact you by email regarding that topic.</p>
<p>You can always have your email address removed from our mailing lists. There are multiple ways to do it:</p>
<p>Once your account is registered, just sign in and unsubscribe from newsletters in profile settings.<br>Use the “Unsubscribe” link in our newsletters that you receive.<br>Send an email to <a href="mailto:{$settings.Company.company_newsletter_email}">{$settings.Company.company_newsletter_email}</a></p>
<p>We may use a third-party email service (MailChimp and/or Mad Mimi) to send newsletters. Some members of our staff can view mailing lists with email addresses. That way they’ll be able to remove your email address from the mailing list, should you request us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that mailing lists are independent from each other. If you decide not to receive newsletters at all, you’ll have to unsubscribe from all the mailing lists. Even if you do that, you’ll still receive account-related emails (such as order status notifications, password reset emails, and more). It is essential for operating an online store.</p>
<p>If you decide that you no longer want to use our store and would like to have your personal data removed from our database (or if you’d like to get all the personal data associated with your account that we have), please send an email to <a href="mailto:{$settings.Company.company_newsletter_email}">{$settings.Company.company_newsletter_email}</a></p>
<p>If you believe that your personal data has been misused, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. We’re obliged by EU General Data Protection Regulation to let you know about this right; we don’t actually intend to misuse your data.</p>
